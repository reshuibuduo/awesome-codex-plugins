## Start Here

New plugin workflow:

1. Create with `$plugin-creator`
2. **Validate with [`plugin-scanner`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/hol-guard)** — **Required: score ≥ 80, no high/critical findings**
3. **Gate PRs with the [HOL scanner GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action)** — **Required for listing**
4. Ship or submit with confidence

### Quick preflight

```bash
pipx run plugin-scanner lint .
pipx run plugin-scanner verify .
```

### Scanner Requirements (Mandatory for This List)

All plugins submitted to **Awesome Codex Plugins** must pass the HOL AI Plugin Scanner:

| Requirement  | Threshold                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Score**    | ≥ 80 / 130                                     |
| **Severity** | No critical or high findings                   |
| **CI**       | Scanner must run in your repo's GitHub Actions |

See the full guide: [`SCANNER_GUIDE.md`](./SCANNER_GUIDE.md)  
See contributing requirements: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

This repo publishes a Codex repo marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. The marketplace points at mirrored installable plugin bundles under `./plugins/`, so a clone of this repo can act as a curated plugin source in Codex.

### Use this marketplace in Codex

Install plugins directly from this curated list by pointing Codex at the repo marketplace:

**CLI:**

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace source (one-time setup)
codex plugin marketplace add \
  'https://github.com/hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins.git' \
  --ref 'main' \
  --sparse '.agents/plugins' \
  --sparse 'plugins'

# Then browse and install (the marketplace name is derived from the repo name)
codex plugin list --source awesome-codex-plugins
codex plugin install <plugin-name> --source awesome-codex-plugins
```

Do not use the raw `marketplace.json` URL with `codex plugin marketplace add`.
The Codex marketplace command clones a Git repository, so a raw GitHub file URL is
treated like a repo URL and fails with `remote: 404: Not Found`.

**Desktop App / IDE Extension:**

1. Open Codex settings → Plugins → Next to search plugins input click on menu and select → `+Add More...`
   <img width="1462" height="466" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae15f505-58a8-4199-bb7b-56a07b670b10" />

2. Add this URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins.git
   ```

   <img width="1974" height="1064" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffbae59f-41ae-4ee3-9d52-864273ecdcb3" />

3. The curated plugin list appears as an available marketplace source.

Each plugin entry includes a `source.path` pointing at a mirrored bundle under `./plugins/` in this repo, so installations are fast and reproducible without hitting upstream repos at install time.

## Plugin Development

### Getting Started

- [Official Docs: Agent Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) - The skill authoring format.
- [Official Docs: Build Plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build) - Author and package plugins.
- [Plugin Structure](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build#create-a-plugin-manually) - `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest format.

### Plugin Anatomy

```
my-plugin/
├── .codex-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: name, version, description, skills path
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill/
│       ├── SKILL.md          # Required: skill instructions + metadata
│       ├── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
│       └── references/       # Optional: docs and templates
├── apps/                     # Optional: app integrations
└── mcp.json                  # Optional: MCP server configuration
```

### Plugin Creator

Use the built-in skill to scaffold a new plugin:

```
$plugin-creator
```

### Publishing

Currently no self-serve marketplace submission. Plugins are distributed via local marketplaces (`~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), repo marketplaces (`$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), or GitHub repos by pointing a marketplace source at a repo. OpenAI has stated third-party marketplace submissions are coming soon.

For this curated list, the machine-readable source of truth is the generated repo marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. We keep the README for humans and `plugins.json` as a compatibility export for existing automation.

## Validate Before You Ship

After scaffolding with `$plugin-creator`, use [`plugin-scanner`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/hol-guard) as your quality gate before publishing, review, or distribution.

For skill/plugin authoring workflows, [Codex SkillForge](https://github.com/f0d010c/skillforge) provides an ESLint-style CLI and GitHub Action for scaffolding, linting, smoke-testing, and packaging Codex skills/plugins before publishing.

### Local Preflight

```bash
pipx run plugin-scanner lint .
pipx run plugin-scanner verify .
```

### PR Gate (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    fail_on_severity: high
```

### Submission Preflight

Use scanner outputs as evidence for maintainers/reviewers:

- Structural lint results
- Publish-readiness verification output
- SARIF/findings for CI and code scanning

The score is best used as a quick trust signal and triage summary (not the only readiness signal).

## Related Projects

- [awesome-ai-plugins](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/awesome-ai-plugins) - Umbrella list covering Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and MCP servers.
- [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins) - Browse plugins with scanner-backed security analysis and trust scores.

## Claim Your Plugin

Verify ownership of your plugin on the [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins) to display a verified badge on your listing.

### How to claim

1. Go to [hol.org/guard/plugins](https://hol.org/guard/plugins) and sign in with GitHub
2. Find your plugin in the list and click **Verify Ownership**
3. Authorize the read-only GitHub connection (view your profile, email, and public org membership — no write access)
4. Once verified, your plugin listing will display a **Verified** badge

That's it. The verification confirms you are the repository owner or an organization admin. Plugins owned by organizations may require additional review.

> **Note:** You only need to verify once per plugin. If your verification needs to be reset, contact support at `support@hol.org`.

## Plugin Trust Scores

Every plugin in this list is automatically ingested by the [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins), which runs each through the [`plugin-scanner`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/hol-guard) to produce a trust score and security analysis.

A snapshot of scored installable plugins (plus modeled Guard runtime fixtures and public advisories) is published on Hugging Face as [HOL Plugin Security](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HashgraphOnline/hol-plugin-security). Scan ≠ safety guarantee. Catalog plugin count is not the Registry Broker agent catalog. HOL publishes it; not independent validation. Cite this curated list with [`CITATION.cff`](./CITATION.cff).

Each plugin gets a detailed breakdown across six factors:

- **Installability** - Can the plugin be installed and run without errors?
- **Maintenance** - Is the repo actively maintained with clear documentation?
- **MCP Posture** - How securely are MCP servers configured?
- **Plugin Security** - Does the manifest follow security best practices?
- **Provenance** - Can the publisher's identity be verified?
- **Publisher Quality** - Does the publisher have a track record of quality releases?

You can embed a trust badge in your plugin's README:

```
[![Plugin Name on HOL Registry (Trust Score)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhol.org%2Fapi%2Fregistry%2Fbadges%2Fplugin%3Fslug%3DOWNER%252FREPO%26metric%3Dtrust%26style%3Dfor-the-badge%26label%3DPlugin+Name)](https://hol.org/registry/plugins/OWNER%2FREPO)
```

Replace `OWNER%2FREPO` with your plugin's GitHub owner and repo name (URL-encoded slash). Metrics available: `trust`, `security`. Styles: `flat`, `flat-square`, `plastic`, `for-the-badge`, `social`.

### HOL Guard Protection Badge

Show that your plugin repo is protected by [HOL Guard](https://hol.org/guard):

```
[![HOL Guard](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhol.org%2Fapi%2Fregistry%2Fbadges%2Fguard%2FOWNER%2FREPO%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square)](https://hol.org/guard)
```

The badge checks your repo for HOL Guard adoption (config files, CI workflows, dependencies) and displays `Protected` (green) or `Unprotected` (grey). To get the badge:

1. Install HOL Guard: `pipx install hol-guard && hol-guard init`
2. Or add the scanner to CI: `uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1`
3. Add the badge markdown to your README (replace `OWNER%2FREPO`)

## Plugin Quality

If you received a scanner report on your repo, check the [Scanner Guide](SCANNER_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions, common fixes, and CI setup.

## Contributing
